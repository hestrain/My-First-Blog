## Usage
This webpage can be used to write & view blog posts that you write on your own computer (as it only uses localStorage at the moment). Many blog posts can be viewed at once after you have written them. 

The live webpage can be found hosted on github at the following link: hestrain.github.io/My-First-Blog
The code repository can be found on github at the following link: https://github.com/hestrain/My-First-Blog
